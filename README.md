### Purpose

As part of a team of developers and copyrighters (headed by Hannah Kingsolver), we created a website to consolidate information for black-owned businesses primarily in the DFW area. In light of recent events, we wanted to create a space to promote businesses and ideas that aligned with our belief that Black Lives Matter.
